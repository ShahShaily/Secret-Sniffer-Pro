# 🛡️ SEC-SNIFFER PRO
**"High-Precision Real-time Secret Scanner & Security Auditor Tool"**

SEC-SNIFFER PRO is a professional-grade Static Application Security Testing (SAST) engine designed to find hardcoded credentials, API keys, and tokens before they lead to a breach.
Unlike traditional scanners that flood you with junk findings, SEC-SNIFFER PRO focuses on Accuracy, Context, and Actionable Results.

* **🚀 Why Choose SEC-SNIFFER PRO?**
Standard scanners often generate thousands of results, 90% of which are "False Positives" (junk data). SEC-SNIFFER PRO is engineered for high-fidelity detection—delivering fewer alerts, but ensuring every result is a verified True Positive.
* **Security Philosophy "Better to flag 10 safe things than to miss 1 dangerous secret."**

## 🌟 Key Features

* **🤖 AI-Powered Leak Analysis**: Uses intelligent logic to verify "threat potential." It analyzes variable names and code context to confirm real credentials, acting like a virtual security researcher.
* **📉 Smart False-Positive Shield**: Advanced filtering automatically ignores dummy data (e.g., test_password) and common placeholders that usually trigger false alarms.
* **🎯 Heuristic Entropy Discovery**: Uses Shannon Entropy to catch "silent" leaks—randomly generated strings like encryption keys or custom tokens that standard regex misses.
* **📍 Exact Line-Level Precision**: Points you to the Exact Line Number and file path for every finding, allowing for instant verification and lightning-fast fixes.
* **⚠️ Intelligent Risk Classification**: Performs a Permission Audit. If a secret is found in a "World-Readable" file, the risk is automatically escalated to CRITICAL.
* **🛰️ Live 'Watchdog' Monitoring**: Monitors your project live. The moment you save a file, the 'Watchdog' logic re-scans it in seconds for immediate feedback.
* **🔔 Instant Audio-Visual Alerts**: Triggers a Windows Beep and a visual GUI warning the moment a critical leak is detected, preventing secrets from ever being committed.
* **☁️ Cloud-Native CI/CD Integration**: Fully integrated with GitHub Actions. Automatically triggers a security audit on every push or pull_request, acting as an automated quality gate for your            DevOps pipeline.
* **🖥️ Dual-Mode Execution Engine**: Supports both a rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) for desktop users and a high-performance Headless CLI mode for servers, Docker containers, and automation            scripts.
* **🛡️ Zero-Trust Git Guardian**: Deep-scans commit history and metadata to ensure no legacy secrets are hidden in your project's version control history.
* **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Multi-threaded engine intelligently skips heavy folders like node_modules and .git for lightning-fast scanning of large repositories.
* **📍 Dynamic Risk Classification**: Automatically categorizes leaks as CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW based on live status, file permissions, and data randomness.
* **⚠️ Live API Validation Engine**: Automatically verifies if Google and GitHub tokens are still active or expired by communicating with their official servers.
* **📊 Professional Reporting**: Generates audit-ready reports in Interactive HTML Dashboard, JSON, and CSV formats for seamless security documentation.
* **🖥️ Responsive GUI**: A clean, multi-threaded Tkinter interface that stays smooth and responsive even during heavy background operations.

**📊 Professional Reporting Suite**

* **Audit-ready reports are generated in three formats**:
* **Interactive HTML Dashboard**: A dark-themed, searchable UI with color-coded risk badges and fix instructions.
* **JSON Output**: Clean, structured data ready for CI/CD Pipelines or automated security workflows.
* **CSV Export**: Spreadsheet-friendly format for compliance and deep-dive audits.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Logic**: AI-Contextual Filtering + Hybrid Regex + Shannon Entropy.
* **UI**: Responsive Tkinter with asynchronous Queue handling.
* **Automation**: GitHub Actions (YAML) integration for continuous security auditing (CI/CD).
* **Execution**: Headless CLI Mode for seamless integration into server-side environments and DevOps pipelines.
* **Performance**: Multi-threaded I/O for real-time file monitoring without UI lag.
* **Remediation**: Built-in guidance for .env migration and secret rotation.

## 🚀 How to Use

* **Option 1**: Desktop Mode (Graphical Interface)
* **Clone the Repository**: git clone https://github.com/ShahShaily/SEC-SNIFFER-PRO.git
* **Install Requirements**: Run this command to install the Validation Engine: python -m pip install requests 
* **Launch the Application**: python sensitive_finder.py
* **Operation**:
* Click the 'Browse' button to select your target project folder.
* Click 'Start Monitor' to begin the security audit.
* The tool will run in the background. If a secret is saved in any file, you will hear an Instant Beep Alert and see a visual warning!

* **Option 2**: Cloud Mode (GitHub Actions Automation)
* SEC-SNIFFER PRO is pre-configured for Continuous Security Monitoring:
* Automatic Scan: Simply push your code to GitHub. The tool will automatically start scanning your files in the cloud.
* Check Reports: Go to the 'Actions' tab in your GitHub repository to see the live security audit logs.
* Pipeline Protection: If a leak is detected, GitHub will alert you immediately, ensuring no sensitive data is ever merged.
